# Welcome {-}

Due to the multivariate character of many econometric topics, matrix algebra is a commonly used tool in modern econometrics.
It provides a powerful and efficient framework for representing and manipulating systems of linear equations.
This short lecture note series provides a brief introduction to the most relevant matrix algebra concepts for econometricians and their implementation in R.
